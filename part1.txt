Object and function Exercise                                                                                                                                                                    
Part 1
1. Create an object that has your firstName, lastName, and occupation as keys.
Solution                     
Var FirstLastOccupation{
first_Name: “Tahiru”,
Last_name: “Tajudin”,
Occupation: ” software Engineer”
};
2. Access each value from your object using both dot notation and bracket notation
solution
Dot Notation.
FirstLastOccupation.First_Name //Return Tahiru
FirstLastOccupation.Last_Name // Return Tajudin
FirstLastOccupation.Occupation //Return Software Engineer

Bracket Notation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
FirstLastOccupation[First_Name] //Return Tahiru
FirstLastOccupation[Last_Name] // Return Tajudin
FirstLastOccupation[Occupation] //Return Software Engineer

Add a key for hobby to your object. Remove the key and value for occupation.

solution 
>>FirstLastOccupation.hobby = "reading" 
>>Delete FirstLastOccupation.Occupation

What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation?  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Given the following object below, write code to print the value then the key to the console separated by '=>': 
var namesAndHobbies = {
    elie: "JavaScript",
    matt: "jogging",
    janey: "table building",
    tim: "sailing"



Solution
var namesAndHobbies = {
for ( var equalGrater in var namesAndHobbies){
}
 console.log( "=>",FirstLastOccupation[equalGrater]);
Below is the output
// JavaScript => elie
// jogging => matt
// table building => janey
// sailing => tim

4. Add a key for your name, and a value for your favorite hobby to the namesAndHobbies object.  
solution                                                                                            
namesAndHobbies.My_Name = “Tahiru”
namesAndHobies.Hobbies = “Javascript, HTML”

5. Write an if statement that console.logs your name and hobby to the console if the key of your name is contained in the object.

solution
If (“My_Name”,”Hobbies” in namesAndHobies){
console.log(“your Name and Hobbies are existed”)
}
If  If (“Not My_Name”,”Hobbies” in namesAndHobies){
}
console.log(“your Name and Hobbies are Not existing”)
}
